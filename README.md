# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
....................................
//npx hardhat clean
//npm hardhat compile
//npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
//npx hardhat verify 0xD92eBD3858c8Dd81407A1E6ea99E1BcE1a51a472 --network mumbai    
```
